# [Research Methods in Psychology at Goldsmiths 2022-3](http://researchmethods.littlemonkeylab.com/)

Source code for the course website for PS52007D Research Methods in Psychology - coordinated by Dr. Gordon Wright in 2022-3 at Goldsmiths, University of London.
The material of record (including video recordings and submissions) is all held within the Goldsmiths Virtual Learning Environment. What you find here is a live experimental project, where I hope you will try some new things with me, give me your most incisive feedback, and have a bit of fun sharing our journey this year.

## Website notes

-   The purpose of this website is to make a push towards more curated Open Educational Resources and tools to assist my students in the running of their first original research in their second year of undergraduate study. I firmly believe that they can help me develop a set of resources that bring the inimitable Goldsmiths flair to the exciting world of psychological research. This is very much a work in progress this year - all comments welcome. 
-   If any students happen to be reading this... Thank you for jumping in to GitHub, and please contribute here (or in person in labs). I need all the help I can get!
-   In an effort to make materials more consistently accessible and user-friendly, I have adopted a widespread use of [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) produced by the Braille Institute and offered free for use. I like it. I'm still working on my colour palette, and my own colour-blindness is making that a little tougher than I thought, but a great prompt to use CSS at all times! 

## Grovelling attributions and hearty thanks

-   This has been my first journey into this sort of thing, and so much of this website design was shamelessly based on [Sta199-f22-1.github.io](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/) artfully produced by Dr. Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel (legend!). 
-   Her website design wass based on sites created by these phenomenal individuals: [ESPM-157 by Carl Boettinger](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/), [STA 112 by Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://sta-112-f22.github.io/website/), and [PMAP 8521 by Andrew Heiss](https://evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com/).
-   Materials are based on [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/) as well as on previous STA 199s taught by [Maria Tackett](https://maria-tackett.netlify.app/) and [Alex Fisher](https://stat.duke.edu/alexander-fisher).
-   To everyone above. If you are ever in London, I owe you a beer!
