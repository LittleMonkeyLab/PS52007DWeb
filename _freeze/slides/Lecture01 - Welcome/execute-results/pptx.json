I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to\n    speak with someone outside of the course, your advisors and deans\n    are excellent resources.\n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about\n    diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class\n    (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me\n    about it.\n:::\n\n## Accessibility\n\n-   The [Student Disability Access Office\n    (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure\n    that students are able to engage with their courses and related\n    assignments.\n\n-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm\n    always learning how to do this better. If any course component is\n    not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me\n    know.\n\n# Course policies\n\n## COVID policies\n\n-   Wear a mask at all times!\n\n-   Read and follow university guidance\n\n## Late work, waivers, regrades policy\n\n-   We have policies!\n-   Read about them on the [course\n    syllabus](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/course-syllabus.html) and\n    refer back to them when you need it\n\n## Collaboration policy\n\n-   Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed\n    collaboratively.\n\n-   Homeworks must be completed individually. You may **not** directly\n    share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss\n    the problems in general and ask for advice.\n\n-   Exams must be completed individually. You may **not** discuss any\n    aspect of the exam with peers. If you have questions, post as\n    private questions on the course forum, only the teaching team will\n    see and answer.\n\n## Sharing / reusing code policy\n\n-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and\n    many tasks may have solutions posted\n\n-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you\n    may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community,\n    StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained\n    any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).\n\n-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited\n    will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source\n\n## Academic integrity\n\n> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:\n>\n> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\n>\n> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\n>\n> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n## Most importantly!\n\nAsk if you're not sure if something violates a policy!\n\n## This week's tasks\n\n-   Get a GitHub account if you don't have one (some advice for choosing\n    a username\n    [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice \"Happy Git with R\"))\n-   Complete the Getting to know you survey if you haven't yet done so!\n-   Read the syllabus\n\n## Midori says...\n\n[![](images/01/midori.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Picture of my cat, Midori, with a speech bubble that says \\\"Read the syllabus and make Mine happy!\\\"\"\nfig-align=\"center\"\nwidth=\"700\"}](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/course-syllabus.html)\n\n## It's the R community! 💛\n\n[![](images/01/corn.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of a tweet from Rafa Moral saying he recorded an R version of the \\\"it's corn\\\" viral hit\"\nfig-align=\"center\"\nwidth=\"500\"}](https://twitter.com/rafamoral/status/1564376662971760642)\n",
